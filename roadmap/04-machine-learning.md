# Step 4: Machine Learning Foundations (2 Months)

**Goal:** Understand the core concepts of Machine Learning and learn to build, evaluate, and interpret predictive models.

## ü§ñ Core Concepts & Algorithms

Start with the fundamentals before jumping into complex models.

### Free Resources:
1.  **Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng** (THE Classic)
    *   **Link:** [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
    *   **Why:** Builds a incredibly strong theoretical foundation. **Apply for Financial Aid to get it for free.**

2.  **Kaggle's Machine Learning Course** (Very Practical)
    *   **Link:** [Kaggle Learn: Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
    *   **Why:** Quick, practical introduction using `scikit-learn`. No heavy math.

3.  **Google's Machine Learning Crash Course**
    *   **Link:** [ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
    *   **Why:** Great overview with videos and exercises from Google.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hands-On with Scikit-Learn

The workhorse library for traditional ML in Python.

### Practice:
1.  Work through the official [Scikit-Learn Tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html).
2.  Go to Kaggle and enter the **[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)** competition. It's the perfect beginner playground.
