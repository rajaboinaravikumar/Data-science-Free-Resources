 # Step 1: Basics & Foundations (1-2 Months)

**Goal:** Build an unshakable foundation in the mathematics and programming fundamentals that all data science is built upon.

## üìö Mathematics for Data Science

A solid intuitive understanding is more important than advanced theoretical knowledge.

### Free Resources:
1.  **Khan Academy** (Start Here)
    *   **Why:** The best place to brush up on concepts. Perfect for building intuition.
    *   **Path:** Search for and complete: "Precalculus," "Statistics and probability," "Linear algebra."

2.  **MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW)** (Go Deeper)
    *   **Linear Algebra:** [MIT 18.06SC by Gil Strang](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) - Focus on lectures 1-10.
    *   **Calculus:** [MIT 18.01SC Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/) - Focus on derivatives and integrals.
    *   **Probability:** [MIT 6.041 Probabilistic Systems Analysis](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/) - The gold standard.

## üêç Programming Fundamentals

**Python is highly recommended.** It's the lingua franca of data science.

### Free Resources:
1.  **Harvard's CS50P** (Best for Absolute Beginners)
    *   **Link:** [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)
    *   **Why:** Engaging, problem-set based learning. Teaches computational thinking.

2.  **Google's Python Class** (Good for a Quick Refresher)
    *   **Link:** [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)
    *   **Why:** Concise, two-day course with great videos and exercises.

3.  **Python for Everybody (Coursera - Audit for Free)**
    *   **Link:** [Py4E by Dr. Charles Severance](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
    *   **Why:** Very gentle and clear introduction, loved by many.

## ‚úÖ Step 1 Completion Checklist

- [ ] **Math:** Feel comfortable with vectors, matrices, basic derivatives/integrals, and probability distributions.
- [ ] **Programming:** Can write scripts using variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and import libraries.
- [ ] **Final Project:** Write a simple program, like a number guessing game or a text-based adventure.
