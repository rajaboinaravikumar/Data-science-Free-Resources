# Step 5: Advanced Topics & AI (2 Months)

**Goal:** Dive into the modern AI landscape, including deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and generative AI.

## üß† Deep Learning & Neural Networks

### Free Resources:
1.  **fast.ai: Practical Deep Learning for Coders**
    *   **Link:** [fast.ai Course](https://course.fast.ai/)
    *   **Why:** Top-down, practical approach. You code state-of-the-art models first, then learn the theory. Highly recommended.

2.  **DeepLearning.AI (Coursera - Audit for Free)**
    *   **Link:** [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
    *   **Why:** Andrew Ng's more modern and in-depth follow-up to his ML course.

## ü§Ø Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Free Resources:
1.  **Google: Generative AI Learning Path**
    *   **Link:** [Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118)
    *   **Why:** Free, high-quality introductory courses on Gen AI, LLMs, and Responsible AI from Google. **Includes free skill badges.**

2.  **Hugging Face NLP Course**
    *   **Link:** [Hugging Face Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1)
    *   **Why:** The best place to learn how to use modern transformer models for NLP tasks.

## ‚úÖ Step 5 Completion Checklist

- [ ] Understand the basic structure of a neural network.
