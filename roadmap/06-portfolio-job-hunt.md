# Step 6: Portfolio & Job Hunt (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Package your skills into a compelling portfolio and learn how to navigate the job market.

## üß∞ Building Your Portfolio

Your GitHub profile is your new resume.

1.  **Create a GitHub Account:** If you don't have one.
2.  **Create a Project Repository for each significant project.** Each should have:
    *   A clear `README.md` with the project's goal, steps, and results.
    *   Clean, well-commented code.
    *   Visualizations and a summary of key findings.
3.  **Pin Your Best Projects:** Pin 6 of your best repositories to your GitHub profile.

### Project Ideas:
*   **Beginner:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset you find interesting.
*   **Intermediate:** A machine learning model that predicts something (house prices, customer churn).
*   **Advanced:** An end-to-end project: scrape data, clean it, build a model, and create a simple web app (using Streamlit or Flask) to showcase it.

## üìù Job Hunting Strategy

1.  **LinkedIn:** Optimize your profile. Add a professional photo, a compelling headline ("Aspiring Data Scientist"), and detail your projects in the "Featured" section.
2.  **Network:** Connect with other data professionals. Comment on posts. Join conversations.
3.  **Apply Strategically:** Don't just spam applications. Tailor your resume and cover letter to each job, highlighting relevant projects.
4.  **Prepare for Interviews:** Practice SQL and Python coding problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and behavioral questions using the STAR method.
