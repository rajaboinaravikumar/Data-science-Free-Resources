# Advanced Data Science Project Ideas

**Goal:** Tackle complex, end-to-end problems that mimic real-world industry scenarios and showcase deep technical skill.

1.  **End-to-End ML Pipeline with MLOps**
    *   **Goal:** Build a model that predicts customer churn. Containerize the model with Docker, create an API with FastAPI, and use MLflow for tracking. Deploy it on Heroku or AWS.
    *   **Skills:** Software Engineering, APIs, MLOps, Cloud Deployment
    *   **Data:** [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

2.  **Recommendation System**
    *   **Goal:** Build a collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation engine for movies or products.
    *   **Skills:** Recommender Systems, Matrix Factorization, Nearest Neighbors
    *   **Data:** [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

3.  **Time Series Forecasting**
    *   **Goal:** Forecast sales or stock prices using models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet.
    *   **Skills:** Time Series Analysis, Feature Engineering for Temporal Data
    *   **Data:** [Store Sales Time Series Forecasting on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting) or [Yahoo Finance Stock Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/)

4.  **Text Summarization or Text Generation**
    *   **Goal:** Fine-tune a transformer model (like T5 or GPT-2) on a custom dataset to generate summaries or creative text.
    *   **Skills:** Transformers, Hugging Face, Transfer Learning
    *   **Data:** [CNN/DailyMail Dataset for Summarization](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cnn_dailymail) or any text corpus you're interested in.

5.  **Object Detection in Images**
    *   **Goal:** Use a pre-trained model like YOLO or SSD to detect and locate multiple objects within an image.
    *   **Skills:** Computer Vision, Transfer Learning, Object Detection
    *   **Data:** [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home)
